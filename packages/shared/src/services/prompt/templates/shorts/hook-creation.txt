Write 5 ultra-short hooks for a Shorts/Reels video about:
"{{idea}}"

Style: {{genre}}

THE 2-SECOND RULE: A hook must work before any audio plays — assume the viewer has sound off. The first visual frame must create enough curiosity to make them tap for sound.

HOOK ANATOMY FOR SHORTS:
- Screen text: MAX 5 words, high contrast, no more than 2 lines
- Visual: One striking image, action, or motion that is immediately legible at mobile scale
- Audio (if heard): One sentence that raises a question the viewer must answer

Write 5 hooks — one of each type:

[HOOK 1 — VISUAL SHOCK]
A striking first frame that looks wrong, surprising, or physically impossible.
Screen text: [5 words max]
Visual: [Describe the opening image/action]
VO (first line only): [One sentence]

[HOOK 2 — BOLD CLAIM]
A text-first hook. The statement is so bold or counterintuitive that the viewer stops to verify.
Screen text: [Statement in 4 words max]
Visual: [Simple, non-distracting background that emphasizes the text]
VO (first line only): [Expand the claim in one sentence]

[HOOK 3 — BEFORE/AFTER TEASE]
Show the end result first. The viewer watches to find out how it was achieved.
Screen text: [Teaser label — "This took 3 days" / "The result ↓"]
Visual: [The impressive final result in frame]
VO (first line only): [Set up the journey: "I started with nothing."]

[HOOK 4 — RELATABLE PAIN]
One sentence that makes the exact target viewer feel understood in 2 seconds.
Screen text: [Pain point in 5 words — format as a question or statement]
Visual: [Viewer's emotional state or the painful situation]
VO (first line only): [Expand the pain, then promise relief]

[HOOK 5 — CURIOSITY GAP]
Give information that is incomplete — the gap between what they know and what they need to know creates compulsive viewing.
Screen text: ["This [thing] changes everything" / "You're doing X wrong"]
Visual: [Something partially revealed]
VO (first line only): [The missing piece setup: "Most people don't know that..."]

After the 5 hooks, identify which best fits the {{genre}} Shorts format and explain in one sentence.
