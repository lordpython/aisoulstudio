{{language_instruction}}
{{references}}
Write a complete, production-ready screenplay for:
"{{idea}}"

Target duration: {{minDuration}}-{{maxDuration}} minutes.

FORMAT (standard screenplay format, adapted for short film):
- Scene headings: INT./EXT. LOCATION — TIME
- Action lines: Present tense, active voice, what the camera actually sees
- Character names: CENTERED, ALL CAPS on first appearance
- Dialogue: Character name centered above their lines
- Parentheticals: Only when essential for performance direction

STORYTELLING REQUIREMENTS:
- Open on a compelling image that encapsulates the theme — no expository dialogue in scene 1
- Each scene must advance plot OR reveal character — never just both, always at least one
- The protagonist must make an active choice that drives the story forward in each act
- Subtext over text: characters rarely say exactly what they mean
- Visual storytelling: at least 1 key moment must be told entirely through action, no dialogue

STRUCTURE:
[ACT 1 — SETUP]: Establish world, protagonist, and want (the stated goal)
[ACT 2A — ESCALATION]: Pursuit of goal meets increasing obstacles; reveal need (real underlying desire)
[MIDPOINT]: A revelation or reversal that changes the stakes
[ACT 2B — DARK NIGHT]: The lowest point — protagonist must change or fail
[ACT 3 — RESOLUTION]: Active climax driven by the protagonist; need triumphs over or redefines want

GENRE: {{genre}} — honor genre conventions while subverting at least one expectation.
Write the full screenplay with proper formatting. Include scene numbers.
