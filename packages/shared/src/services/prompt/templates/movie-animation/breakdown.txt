Before writing, silently identify:
- The protagonist and their central desire or goal
- The core conflict they face (internal or external)
- The emotional arc: how does the protagonist change from start to finish?
- One key turning point per act

Create a narrative breakdown for a {{genre}} story about:
"{{idea}}"

Divide into 3-5 acts. For each act provide:
1. Title — A compelling act title referencing a specific story moment (not generic like "Introduction")
2. Emotional Hook — The dominant emotion the audience should feel in this act (grief, awe, tension, triumph...)
3. Narrative Beat — The specific story event or revelation that drives this act forward (name characters, describe the action)

Keep each field concise (1-2 sentences max). Be specific — avoid vague labels like "conflict begins" or "things get harder".
