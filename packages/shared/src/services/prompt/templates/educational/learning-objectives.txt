Define clear, measurable learning objectives for a lesson about:
"{{idea}}"

Target duration: {{minDuration}}-{{maxDuration}} minutes.

OBJECTIVE FRAMEWORK (Bloom's Taxonomy — write objectives at the appropriate cognitive level):

[KNOWLEDGE OBJECTIVE — Remember]
By the end of this video, learners will be able to RECALL or RECOGNIZE:
(List 2-3 specific facts, definitions, or concepts they must retain)
Format: "Learners will identify [specific item] as [definition/characteristic]."

[COMPREHENSION OBJECTIVE — Understand]
By the end of this video, learners will be able to EXPLAIN or DESCRIBE:
(List 1-2 concepts in their own words, without referencing the video)
Format: "Learners will explain [concept] in terms of [real-world context]."

[APPLICATION OBJECTIVE — Apply]
By the end of this video, learners will be able to USE or DEMONSTRATE:
(List 1-2 practical skills or techniques they can perform after watching)
Format: "Learners will apply [skill] to [specific scenario or problem type]."

[ANALYSIS OBJECTIVE — Analyze] (include if duration allows depth)
By the end of this video, learners will be able to DISTINGUISH or COMPARE:
(1 objective involving critical evaluation or pattern recognition)
Format: "Learners will differentiate [A] from [B] based on [criteria]."

OBJECTIVE QUALITY CHECKLIST (verify each objective meets all criteria):
✓ Uses a specific, observable action verb (not "understand", "know", or "appreciate")
✓ Specifies the condition or context for performance
✓ Is achievable within the video's time constraints
✓ Directly maps to content that will appear in the video
✓ Is assessable — a learner could demonstrate success

After objectives, provide:
[PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE]: What learners must already know before watching
[ASSESSMENT IDEAS]: 2-3 questions or tasks that would verify each objective was met
[VISUAL ANCHOR]: One diagram or visual that could represent the entire lesson's core concept
