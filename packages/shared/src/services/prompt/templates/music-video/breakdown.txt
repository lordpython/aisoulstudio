Create a lyric and visual breakdown for a {{genre}} music video about:
"{{idea}}"

Target duration: {{minDuration}}-{{maxDuration}} minutes.

Structure as 3-5 sections following song structure. For each section:
1. Title — Song section name (e.g., "Verse 1", "Pre-Chorus", "Chorus", "Bridge", "Outro")
2. Emotional Hook — The emotional intensity and mood of this section (building desire, cathartic release, introspective, euphoric)
3. Narrative Beat — The lyrical theme and visual concept: what do the lyrics say and what visuals accompany them

MUSIC VIDEO RULES:
- The breakdown defines both the narrative/lyrical content AND the visual treatment
- Chorus sections should be the most visually and emotionally impactful
- Maintain a coherent visual story across sections
- Genre {{genre}} — reflect the genre's visual and sonic conventions

Design for beat-synchronized visuals.
