Write a complete music video script — lyrics and visual treatment — for:
"{{idea}}"

Target duration: {{minDuration}}-{{maxDuration}} minutes.

SONG STRUCTURE AND LYRICS:
Write complete lyrics following standard song structure. Each section labeled:

[VERSE 1] — Establish the narrative, character, or world. Specific imagery over abstractions.
[PRE-CHORUS] — Build emotional tension, raise the stakes. Transition phrase that makes the chorus feel inevitable.
[CHORUS] — The emotional peak. The hook. Repeat 2-4 times across the song. Keep it 4-8 lines max.
[VERSE 2] — Advance the narrative. Introduce new detail or perspective. Don't repeat verse 1 content.
[BRIDGE] — Contrast section: different melody feel, shifted perspective, or emotional release.
[OUTRO] — Resolution or fade. Can echo chorus or introduce a final lyrical turn.

LYRIC CRAFT RULES:
- End-rhyme scheme: ABAB or AABB — consistent within each section
- Count syllables for rhythmic consistency (mark stressed syllables if helpful)
- Use concrete images over emotional abstractions: "broken clock on a cracked wall" not "feeling lost"
- Avoid clichés unless deliberately subverted: "heart of gold" → "a heart like coin-worn copper"
- The chorus hook must be singable within the first 3 words

VISUAL TREATMENT (for each section):
After the lyrics for each section, write:
VISUAL: [Color palette, location, lighting mood, camera movement, visual motif synchronized to this section's energy]

Genre: {{genre}} — ensure lyrics, imagery, and pacing reflect the sonic and visual conventions of this genre.
