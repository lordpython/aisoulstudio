Write a complete, broadcast-ready news script for:
"{{idea}}"

Target duration: {{minDuration}}-{{maxDuration}} minutes.

BROADCAST SCRIPT FORMAT:
Use the standard split-format broadcast script:
[SEGMENT LABEL — e.g., ANCHOR INTRO / FIELD REPORT / EXPERT SOT]
VIDEO: [Visual description — what appears on screen, lower thirds, graphics]
AUDIO: [Anchor/reporter script] (SOURCE: citation when stating facts)

JOURNALISTIC STRUCTURE (Inverted Pyramid):
[ANCHOR INTRO — 30s]: The most newsworthy element first. Who, what, when, where in the first sentence.
[MAIN BODY — context, evidence, perspectives]:
  • PRIMARY FACTS: What happened, verified by at least 2 sources
  • OFFICIAL RESPONSE: Government/organization/company statement (quote or paraphrase)
  • EXPERT ANALYSIS: Independent expert perspective with credentials noted
  • AFFECTED PERSPECTIVE: Human-interest angle — how does this affect real people?
[BALANCE SEGMENT]: Present the strongest counter-perspective or opposing viewpoint fairly
[DATA/GRAPHICS SEGMENT]: Key statistics visualized — cite the source on-screen
[ANCHOR CLOSE — 15s]: What happens next; what to watch for; where to get more information

JOURNALISM STANDARDS:
- Every stated fact requires a [SOURCE] citation immediately after
- Distinguish clearly between confirmed fact, official claim, and analyst opinion
- Avoid loaded language: neutral verbs ("said", "stated", "claimed") not "admitted" or "insisted"
- Specific numbers over vague quantifiers: "37% increase" not "significant rise"
- Named sources preferred; if unnamed, specify why (e.g., "spoke on condition of anonymity because...")
- Include at least one perspective from those most directly affected by the story

Genre/beat: {{genre}}.
