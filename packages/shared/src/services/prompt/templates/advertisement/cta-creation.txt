Write 6 call-to-action variations for an advertisement about:
"{{idea}}"

Genre/style: {{genre}}

The CTA is the last thing the viewer sees and hears. It must convert intent into action.

CTA ARCHITECTURE — every CTA needs all three elements:
1. ACTION VERB — specific, active (not "learn more" — try "claim", "get", "start", "join", "save", "unlock")
2. VALUE REMINDER — a micro-benefit restated at the moment of decision
3. FRICTION REDUCER — remove hesitation (time, money, or effort objection handled)

Write one CTA for each category:

[CTA 1 — URGENCY]
Time or quantity scarcity that is truthful and specific. Never manufactured urgency.
Example frame: "Offer ends [date] — [action] while [condition]."

[CTA 2 — DESIRE]
Lead with what the viewer gets, not what they do. Outcome-first language.
Example frame: "[Desired outcome] — [action] at [where/how]."

[CTA 3 — SOCIAL PROOF]
Reference the crowd. Numbers, community, or authority lend credibility.
Example frame: "Join [number] people who [action] — [CTA]."

[CTA 4 — RISK REVERSAL]
Remove financial or commitment fear directly in the CTA text.
Example frame: "Try it free for [X days] — no [objection]. [Action]."

[CTA 5 — IDENTITY]
Speak to who the viewer wants to be, not what they want to have.
Example frame: "[Identity statement] — [action]."

[CTA 6 — SIMPLICITY]
The shortest possible CTA. One action, one benefit, one sentence.
Maximum 8 words total.

FORMAT FOR EACH:
- Screen text version (max 6 words, large display)
- Voiceover version (spoken, natural, 1-2 sentences)
- Recommended visual treatment for the final frame (2-3 words each)

Close with your recommended CTA and the reason it best fits this {{genre}} advertisement.
