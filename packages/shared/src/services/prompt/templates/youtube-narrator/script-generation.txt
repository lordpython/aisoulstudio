Write a complete, publication-ready YouTube narrator script for:
"{{idea}}"

Target duration: {{minDuration}}-{{maxDuration}} minutes of spoken narration.

SCRIPT FORMAT:
- Open with a pattern-interrupt hook that earns the first 30 seconds (no "welcome back" intros)
- Use second-person address ("you") to create personal connection throughout
- Write at an 8th-grade reading level — clear, direct, zero jargon without explanation
- Include natural transition phrases between segments ("But here's where it gets interesting...", "Now, you might be thinking...")
- End with a clear call-to-action tied back to the opening hook

TONE AND PACING:
- Conversational but authoritative — like a knowledgeable friend, not a textbook
- Vary sentence length: punchy short sentences after each key point, longer ones for context
- Use rhetorical questions to maintain engagement ("So why does this matter to you?")
- Include at least one counter-intuitive fact or surprising angle per major section

STRUCTURE (label each section):
[HOOK] — 30-60 seconds, immediate value promise
[CONTEXT] — Background the viewer needs to understand
[MAIN POINT 1] — First key insight with example
[MAIN POINT 2] — Second insight, build on previous
[MAIN POINT 3+] — Continue as needed for target duration
[CONCLUSION] — Callback to hook, forward value
[CTA] — Subscribe/like/comment prompt that feels earned

{{genre}} genre — adapt the tone accordingly (educational, commentary, review, etc.).
Write the complete script as flowing narration, not bullet points.
