Write a conversational narrator script based on this content breakdown:

{{breakdown}}

Create exactly {{actCount}} scenes — one per segment above. For each scene:
1. Heading — Segment type (e.g., "HOOK - COLD OPEN", "MAIN POINT 1", "TRANSITION", "OUTRO CTA")
2. Action — B-roll visual description: what the viewer sees on screen while the narrator speaks
3. Dialogue — Narrator's spoken script (speaker: "Narrator")

NARRATOR SCRIPT RULES:
- Write as if speaking directly to the viewer — conversational, engaging, and natural
- Use "you" to address the viewer and create connection
- Include pacing cues: rhetorical questions, short punchy sentences, moments of pause
- Reference research facts and citations where relevant
- Keep dialogue lines natural for spoken delivery (no markdown formatting)

Write exactly {{actCount}} scenes.
