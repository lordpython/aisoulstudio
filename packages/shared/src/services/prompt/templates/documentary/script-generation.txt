{{language_instruction}}
{{research}}{{references}}
Write a complete, production-ready documentary script for:
"{{idea}}"

Target duration: {{minDuration}}-{{maxDuration}} minutes. Credibility and narrative tension are equally essential.

DOCUMENTARY SCRIPT FORMAT:
Use three-column notation:
[CHAPTER TITLE]
TIME: [approximate timecode]
VISUAL: [Shot description — archival footage, interview setup, location, graphic]
AUDIO: [Narrator VO text / interview question / ambient sound direction]
SOURCE: [Citation for any stated fact]

STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS:
[COLD OPEN] — Start in the middle of the action; hook before any title card (2-3 min)
[TITLE CARD + CONTEXT] — Establish scope and stakes without giving away the conclusion
[CHAPTER 1 — ORIGINS]: Historical or factual foundation; establish what we're investigating
[CHAPTER 2 — EVIDENCE]: Key findings, testimonies, data; build the case
[CHAPTER 3 — COMPLICATION]: Counter-argument, obstacle, or revelation that deepens complexity
[CHAPTER 4 — IMPLICATIONS]: What this means; expert analysis; who is affected and how
[EPILOGUE] — Where things stand today; what remains unresolved; call to awareness or action

DOCUMENTARY CRAFT:
- Every factual claim must have a [SOURCE] tag with the research citation
- Interview questions (for on-camera subjects) must be open-ended and specific
- Archival footage descriptions must include approximate era and visual content
- Narrator voice: measured, authoritative, without advocacy — present facts and let viewers conclude
- Include at least one "surprise reversal" — a finding that contradicts the expected narrative
- Data visualizations: specify chart type, variables, and visual treatment

Genre/beat: {{genre}}.
