Write a chapter-structured documentary script based on this breakdown:

{{breakdown}}

Create exactly {{actCount}} scenes — one per chapter above. For each scene:
1. Heading — Documentary chapter label (e.g., "CHAPTER 1 — THE BEGINNING", "ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE - 1985")
2. Action — Visual direction: archival footage description, interview setup, data visualization, or location shot
3. Dialogue — Narrator voiceover or interview excerpt (speaker: "Narrator" or "Expert" or source name)

DOCUMENTARY SCRIPT RULES:
- Cite specific sources in dialogue when stating facts
- Describe archival visuals, data charts, or maps concretely in action lines
- Use measured, authoritative narration — let facts speak
- Interview dialogue should feel authentic and sourced
- Include chapter titles as visual title cards in action descriptions
- Reference key research findings and reference document content

Write exactly {{actCount}} scenes.
