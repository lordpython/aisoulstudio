Write a complete, production-ready advertisement script for:
"{{idea}}"

Target duration: {{minDuration}}-{{maxDuration}} seconds. Every word earns its place.

SCRIPT FORMAT:
Write in two parallel columns — VISUAL and AUDIO — to show what the viewer sees and hears simultaneously.
Use this format for each beat:

[BEAT NAME]
VISUAL: [Describe exactly what appears on screen]
AUDIO: [Voiceover line / dialogue / music direction]

PERSUASION ARCHITECTURE:
1. PROBLEM HOOK (0-5s): Immediately surface the pain point or desire — make the viewer feel understood
2. AMPLIFICATION (5-15s): Make the problem feel larger, more urgent, or the desire more compelling
3. SOLUTION REVEAL (15-35s): Introduce the product/service as the natural answer — show, don't tell
4. PROOF POINT (35-50s): One specific, believable benefit with concrete detail (not vague claims)
5. CTA CLOSE (last 5s): Clear action with urgency or exclusivity — "Get yours now", "Limited time", etc.

COPYWRITING RULES:
- Lead with emotion, close with logic
- Every adjective must earn its place — cut "amazing", "incredible", "revolutionary"
- The product name appears no more than 3 times total
- CTA must be the last spoken line and appear visually at the same moment
- Music direction: specify tempo and mood, not genre (e.g., "building percussion, 85 BPM" not "hip-hop")

Genre/style: {{genre}}. Calibrate tone for this specific ad type.
