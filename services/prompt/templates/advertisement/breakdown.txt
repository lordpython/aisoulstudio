Create a high-impact advertisement breakdown for:
"{{idea}}"

Target duration: {{minDuration}}-{{maxDuration}} seconds. Every second counts.

Structure as 3-4 beats optimized for maximum emotional impact and clear call-to-action. For each beat:
1. Title — The advertising beat name (e.g., "Problem Hook", "Solution Reveal", "CTA Moment")
2. Emotional Hook — The specific emotion triggered in the viewer (urgency, desire, fear of missing out, aspiration)
3. Narrative Beat — The exact message or visual moment, with specific copy direction

ADVERTISEMENT RULES:
- Open with an immediate hook that stops the scroll
- Build desire or solve a clear pain point
- End with a powerful, memorable call-to-action
- Every beat must serve the product/brand goal

Genre: {{genre}}. Tailor the tone accordingly.
