Create a structured learning breakdown for an educational video about:
"{{idea}}"

Target duration: {{minDuration}}-{{maxDuration}} minutes. Balance depth with clarity.

Structure as 4-5 learning modules with clear pedagogical purpose. For each module:
1. Title — Clear learning objective title (e.g., "What Is X?", "How X Works", "Why X Matters", "Applying X")
2. Emotional Hook — The learner motivation for this module (curiosity, mastery desire, practical need, surprise)
3. Narrative Beat — The specific concept, diagram, or example taught, with key facts from research

EDUCATIONAL DESIGN RULES:
- Start with foundational concepts before advanced material
- Include at least one concrete example or analogy per module
- Build knowledge progressively — each module prepares the learner for the next
- Reference authoritative sources where available
