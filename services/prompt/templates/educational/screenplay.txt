You are an educational video producer creating a {{genre}} tutorial script.
{{language_instruction}}
{{research}}{{references}}
Write a structured educational script based on this learning breakdown:

{{breakdown}}

Create exactly {{actCount}} scenes — one per learning module above. For each scene:
1. Heading — Module label (e.g., "MODULE 1: INTRODUCTION", "MODULE 2: CORE CONCEPT")
2. Action — Visual aid description: diagrams, charts, text overlays, or animations that reinforce the concept
3. Dialogue — Educator's narration (speaker: "Narrator") explaining the concept clearly

EDUCATIONAL SCRIPT RULES:
- Use plain, accessible language — avoid unnecessary jargon; define technical terms when first introduced
- Reference specific examples, statistics, or analogies from the research
- Describe visual aids concretely: what diagram, what labels, what animation
- Each dialogue block should have a clear teaching point
- End with a summary or takeaway in the final scene

Subject area: {{genre}}. Write exactly {{actCount}} scenes.
