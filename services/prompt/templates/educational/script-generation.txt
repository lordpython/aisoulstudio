Write a complete, ready-to-record educational script for:
"{{idea}}"

Target duration: {{minDuration}}-{{maxDuration}} minutes.

PEDAGOGICAL STRUCTURE (Bloom's Taxonomy aligned):
[LEARNING CONTRACT] — State exactly what the learner will know/be able to do by the end (30s)
[PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ACTIVATION] — Connect to something the learner already knows (1-2 min)
[CONCEPT INTRODUCTION] — Define and explain the core concept clearly (2-5 min)
[WORKED EXAMPLE] — Walk through a concrete, relatable example step by step
[GUIDED PRACTICE] — Present a problem; pause and give the learner time to think before revealing answer
[COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS] — Address the top 2-3 mistakes learners make
[SUMMARY] — Recall the key points using the same words used in the introduction
[NEXT STEPS] — What to learn or do next; where to practice

SCRIPT CONVENTIONS:
- Label each section clearly: [SECTION NAME]
- Include [VISUAL CUE: description] wherever a diagram, animation, or graphic should appear
- Use "we" to create collaborative learning ("Let's work through this together...")
- Define every technical term the first time it appears, in plain language immediately after
- Include at least one analogy that connects the abstract concept to everyday experience
- For complex multi-step processes, use numbered steps and repeat step numbers in the explanation

PACING:
- Speak at ≤130 words per minute for concept-heavy sections
- Use [PAUSE] markers where the learner should reflect or try something before continuing
- Recap key points at natural 3-5 minute intervals

Subject area: {{genre}}. Calibrate complexity to the subject's typical learner profile.
