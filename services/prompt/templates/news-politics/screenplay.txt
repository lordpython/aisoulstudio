Write a professional news report script based on this breakdown:

{{breakdown}}

Create exactly {{actCount}} scenes — one per reporting segment above. For each scene:
1. Heading — Broadcast label (e.g., "ANCHOR DESK - LIVE", "FIELD REPORT", "EXPERT INTERVIEW", "GRAPHIC: DATA VISUALIZATION")
2. Action — Broadcast visual: news desk setup, field location, lower-third graphics, data charts, or archival footage
3. Dialogue — Anchor or reporter script (speaker: "Anchor" or "Reporter") with cited facts

NEWS SCRIPT RULES:
- Lead each scene with the most important information first
- Use formal, neutral, professional tone throughout
- Cite sources by name when stating specific facts or statistics
- Describe news graphics and lower thirds concretely in action lines
- Balance perspectives across scenes — include multiple viewpoints
- No advocacy — report facts and let viewers draw conclusions

Write exactly {{actCount}} scenes.
