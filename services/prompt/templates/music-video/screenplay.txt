Write a music video script based on this breakdown:

{{breakdown}}

Create exactly {{actCount}} scenes — one per song section above. For each scene:
1. Heading — Song section and visual context (e.g., "VERSE 1 — ABANDONED WAREHOUSE", "CHORUS — ROOFTOP SUNSET")
2. Action — Visual direction: color palette, lighting mood, camera movement, and visual motifs synchronized to the beat
3. Dialogue — Song lyrics for this section (speaker: "Lyrics")

MUSIC VIDEO SCRIPT RULES:
- Lyrics should feel authentic to the {{genre}} genre and topic
- Action descriptions should describe cinematic visuals that complement the lyrics
- Include specific color grading and lighting notes (e.g., "warm golden hour", "neon-drenched darkness")
- Camera movements should feel musical — slow push in on emotional lines, wide shots on anthemic moments
- The visual narrative should enhance, not distract from, the emotional journey of the song

Write exactly {{actCount}} scenes.
