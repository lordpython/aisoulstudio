You are a professional lyricist writing original lyrics for a {{genre}} song.
{{language_instruction}}
Write complete, original song lyrics for a music video about:
"{{idea}}"

Target duration: {{minDuration}}-{{maxDuration}} minutes.

SONG STRUCTURE (write all sections in order):

[VERSE 1] — 8-12 lines
Establish the world, character, or situation. Anchor the song in specific, concrete imagery.
Rhyme scheme: ABAB or AABB — choose one and stay consistent throughout.

[PRE-CHORUS] — 4 lines (optional, include if genre convention expects it)
Build tension. Make the chorus feel inevitable. Use ascending syllable count for each line.

[CHORUS] — 6-8 lines
THE HOOK. These are the lines the listener sings in the shower.
- First line must contain the title or central phrase
- Melody must be implied through rhythm — mark stressed syllables with CAPS
- Must work as a standalone emotional statement with no context

[VERSE 2] — 8-12 lines
Advance the story or deepen the theme. Do NOT repeat verse 1 content.
Introduce new perspective, location, or character development.

[CHORUS] — Repeat (mark as CHORUS REPEAT)

[BRIDGE] — 6-8 lines
Contrast section: different emotional register, opposing viewpoint, or resolution moment.
Often the most personal, vulnerable, or elevated section of the song.

[FINAL CHORUS / OUTRO] — 8-12 lines
Modified chorus with added emotional weight. Can extend the hook or add new layers.
Final line must feel like an ending, not a fade.

LYRIC CRAFT REQUIREMENTS:
- Syllable count consistency within matched lines (count and note if needed)
- Zero filler words: "baby", "yeah", "oh" only if genre convention demands them
- One extended metaphor sustained across at least two sections
- Avoid the exact title phrase in verse lines — save it for chorus impact

Genre: {{genre}} — ensure diction, imagery, and cadence match the genre's conventions and audience expectations.
