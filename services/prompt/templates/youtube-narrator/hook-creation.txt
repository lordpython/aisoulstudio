Write 5 alternative hook options for a YouTube video about:
"{{idea}}"

Genre: {{genre}}

Each hook must accomplish three things in under 60 seconds of spoken content:
1. STOP — Interrupt the viewer's passive scrolling with something unexpected or urgent
2. PROMISE — Make a specific, believable, desirable promise about what they'll learn or feel
3. WITHHOLD — Create a curiosity gap that can only be closed by watching the full video

HOOK TYPES — write one of each:

[HOOK 1 — CONTRARIAN CLAIM]
Open with a statement that directly contradicts a widely-held belief related to {{idea}}.
Then promise to prove it with evidence.

[HOOK 2 — STORY OPEN]
Drop the viewer into the middle of a specific, vivid moment. Name a real person, place, and situation.
Don't explain — just describe. The promise is implied by the intrigue of the scene.

[HOOK 3 — DIRECT PROMISE]
State the exact value the viewer will gain. Use numbers and specifics.
"By the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to [specific outcome]."

[HOOK 4 — QUESTION HOOK]
Ask the one question your target viewer has been asking themselves privately.
Make them feel seen. The video answers it.

[HOOK 5 — STAKES HOOK]
Open with a consequence: what happens if the viewer does NOT know this?
Create urgency without being manipulative — the stakes must be real and relevant.

FORMAT FOR EACH HOOK:
- Written as complete spoken script (not notes or bullets)
- Maximum 90 words per hook
- End each hook on a cliffhanger that demands continuation

After the 5 hooks, recommend which one best fits the {{genre}} format and explain why in 2 sentences.
