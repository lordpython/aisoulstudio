Create a structured content breakdown for a YouTube narrator video about:
"{{idea}}"

Target duration: {{minDuration}}-{{maxDuration}} minutes of narration.

Divide into 4-5 segments optimized for B-roll narration with conversational pacing. For each segment:
1. Title — A hook-based chapter title that creates curiosity or promises clear value
2. Emotional Hook — Why viewers stay engaged in this segment (curiosity, awe, surprise, relatability, urgency)
3. Narrative Beat — The key information or insight covered, with specific facts, examples, or data points

Design each segment to flow naturally into the next. Include any research citations where relevant.
Avoid generic labels — each segment should feel like a distinct, engaging chapter.
