Design a complete chapter structure for a documentary about:
"{{idea}}"

Target duration: {{minDuration}}-{{maxDuration}} minutes.

CHAPTER ARCHITECTURE:
Each chapter must have a distinct emotional and informational function. No two chapters should feel the same.

For each chapter, provide:

CHAPTER [NUMBER]: [TITLE]
DURATION: [Approximate minutes]
FUNCTION: [What this chapter accomplishes narratively and informationally]
EMOTIONAL JOURNEY: [How the viewer should feel entering → during → leaving this chapter]
KEY CONTENT:
  - Primary finding or revelation
  - Evidence types (archival footage, interview, data, location)
  - Sourced facts from research (cite each one)
CHAPTER CLOSE: [The last image or line that makes the viewer need to watch the next chapter]

REQUIRED CHAPTER TYPES (include all that fit the target duration):

[COLD OPEN] — In medias res. No context. Visceral. Creates the central question.
[ORIGIN CHAPTER] — How did we get here? Historical or causal foundation.
[EVIDENCE CHAPTER] — The case: facts, data, testimony. Build the argument.
[COMPLICATION CHAPTER] — The counter-narrative. What the evidence doesn't explain. Introduces doubt or complexity.
[HUMAN CHAPTER] — Faces and stories. Who is actually affected and how. Empathy anchor.
[RESOLUTION/IMPLICATION CHAPTER] — What it all means. Where we go from here.
[CODA] — Where things stand today. Often more questions than answers.

CHAPTER LINKING:
After writing all chapters, define the THROUGH-LINE:
- The central question posed in chapter 1 that every subsequent chapter advances
- The moment of greatest revelation (which chapter and why)
- The intended emotional state of the viewer at the documentary's final frame

Genre: {{genre}}. Ground every chapter element in the provided research and reference materials.
