Write a fast-paced short video script based on this breakdown:

{{breakdown}}

Create exactly {{actCount}} scenes — one per beat above. For each scene:
1. Heading — Beat label (e.g., "HOOK FRAME", "VALUE DROP", "CTA CLOSE") with mobile context
2. Action — Vertical 9:16 visual: fast cut, bold text overlay, or dynamic visual that fills the phone screen
3. Dialogue — On-screen text or voiceover (speaker: "Narrator" or "Text Overlay")

SHORTS SCRIPT RULES:
- Visuals must be designed for 9:16 vertical mobile screens
- Use fast cuts, bold typography, and high-contrast visuals
- Dialogue should be short punchy lines — no long narration
- Text overlays should be large and readable on a phone screen
- Pacing: hook (0-2s), value (3-20s), close (last 3s)

Write exactly {{actCount}} scenes.
