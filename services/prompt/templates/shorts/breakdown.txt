Create a hook-first content breakdown for a vertical short video about:
"{{idea}}"

Target duration: {{minDuration}}-{{maxDuration}} seconds. Attention is gone in 2 seconds.

Structure as 3 tight beats designed for mobile vertical viewing. For each beat:
1. Title — The beat name (e.g., "PATTERN INTERRUPT HOOK", "CORE VALUE DROP", "LOOP CLOSE / CTA")
2. Emotional Hook — The snap emotional trigger (shock, curiosity gap, FOMO, instant satisfaction, relatability)
3. Narrative Beat — Exactly what happens in this beat — the image, text, or action that lands the punch

SHORTS RULES:
- Beat 1 MUST be a scroll-stopping hook — the first 2 seconds determine everything
- Beat 2 delivers the core value or entertainment fast, no build-up
- Beat 3 creates a loop or drives a share/follow/comment action
- No wasted frames — every second must earn its place
