Act as a Full-Stack Software Architect. Create a detailed technical specification and implementation roadmap for building a professional-grade AI video production and editing application. The system must feature: 1) A React-based frontend using Zustand for multi-store state management, specifically including Production, Generation, UI, and Export stores. 2) A complex, non-linear Timeline Editor component for managing video layers, media sequences, and frame-accurate seeking. 3) A modular Services layer to handle AI-driven video generation, media processing, and export workflows. 4) A hierarchical UI architecture that separates layout components, primitive UI elements, and high-level feature views. 5) Custom React hooks for managing complex video playback logic and state synchronization across the editor. Provide a proposed directory structure, a schema for the global state stores, and the core logic for the timeline synchronization engine.
